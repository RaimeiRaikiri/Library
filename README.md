# Library

Welcome to the Library repository! This repository serves the purpose of practicing and displaying my skills using javascript objects.
In this project I used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

# To view the website

- Follow this link - [Library]()


# About

This website is a project designed by the people at 'The Odin Project' - They tasked me with creating a library of books using an object constructor to create book objects and display their information on the site.

# Features

- 3 pre-added books
- Add new books
- Remove books
- Mark books read

# Results 

The main page ended up looking like this:

And the popup form to add books to the library:
